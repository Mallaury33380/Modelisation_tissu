This is a description of the application. You will find a description of the application and a description of the different 
inputs and how to use these inputs to interact with the application.

			==Description==

The Project C has been realized for school. Its main purpose was to model a falling fabric on obstacles. The fabric is submitted to 
gravity, air's friction, obstacles' friction, ground' friction and rebond's strenght.

			==Features==

- Key: Exit : End the simulation
- Key: Space : Reinitialize the simulation
- Key: P : Pause the simulation

- Key: Plus :Increase the speed of the simulation
- Key: Minus :Decrease the speed of the simulation

	
	You can control the gravity with:
-Key: g


	The program includes a simulation of wind included in the form of a force vector.
It can be control by:

-Key: Z : to increase on the y axis
-Key: s : to decrease on the y axis
-Key: d : to increase on the x axis
-Key: q : to decrease on the x axis
-Key: a : to decrease on the z axis
-Key: e : to increase on the z axis

	You can reset to 0 the wind with:
-Key r

	

	The program includes a flag mod, the gravity is deactivated, you can activate with Key: g
The flag mod is activated by:

-Key: f : to use the flag mod
	


	With this program you can control a jellyfish:
This mod is activated by:

-Key: m

The jellyfish can only go up with

-Key: UP

To reset the jellyfish's strength use:

-Key: r




Thanks for reading and I hope you will enjoy the program.
